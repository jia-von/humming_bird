# Using GitHub API to analyse organisations
This project was created out of my desire to automate my job search using GitHub API. The major reason I am using GitHub for my job search is because I can review their quality of their work on public repositories. Additionally, I am able to filter organisations based on the programming languages and stacks they use, so I may communicate my desire to work with them.

## Setup
Backend uses PostgreSQL Database.
Required modules to be installed in `venv`:

```python
pip install sqlalchemy
pip install pandas
pip install psycopg2
```
